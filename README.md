### plotly-challenge (Homework)

Besides what was mentioned in the actual instructions, I've included a few extras for your viewing and grading pleasure.

1. I appended the Belly Button IDs with "BB_" to make the numbers more ledgable.
2. I appended the Bacterium ID with "OTU " to give meaning to the numbers.
3. Regardless of the number of bars in the bar chart, the bars will always remain the same width.  This was not an easy task.
4. The gauge chart does not have a needle.  I tried and googled for days (literally) to add that needle but it's impossible.
5. There is no pie chart.  It wasn't part of the instructions.
6. When the page loads, the first item in the list also loads as if the item was selected from the list.

If you have any questions, please feel free to reach out to me on Slack.
